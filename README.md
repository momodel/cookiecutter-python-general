# MO mo-cookiecutter-python

A [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template for creating
a MO module in Python. (See also
[mo-cookiecutter-python](https://github.com/xxxx/xxxx))

## Use the template to create package

Install cookiecutter.

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Use cookiecutter to generate a package, following the prompts to fill in the name and authorship of your new JupyterLab extension.

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/xxxx/xxxx
```

## A simple example

The ``src/`` directory of your new extension includes a very simple example of a working extension, written in TypeScript. Use this example as a guide to build your own extension.

## Package name

We suggest that simple extension names start with `mo_` and use underscores if needed to improve readability, such as `mo_mymodule`.
